I made this physics simulation project to put my physics knowledge to use. The project entails designing and putting different physics principles into practice in a virtual setting. Users can interact with objects and watch how they behave according to the laws of physics. Through this simulation, I want to improve my comprehension of the math behind physics. Although I'm still working on it, my aim is to create a variety of simulations for different physics principles.
